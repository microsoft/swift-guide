# Introduction

The Swift coding conventions guide documents many best practices for writing Swift. Guidance here comes from a combination of our collective practical experiences and documentation from Apple. This is meant to be a living document and all contents are perpetually open for debate and improvement. For details on how to contribute, see the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
